# Final Project Proposal
---
### What will (likely) be the name of you game?
My game will probably be called *Roompath*. Very creative. 

## Project Summary 
I plan to make a basic first-person-shooter kind of game wherin the goal is basically to get from the start of the course to the end. There will be enemies along the way the aim to hinder the player with projectiles, and there will likely be map-related obstacles like walls and doors to make the navigation more interesting and combat more dynamic. The player will have either a health bar or a lives counter that will start at the maximum amount at the beginning of the course and will become depleted my enemy projectiles. In traditional FPS fashion (for some games at least), I'd maybe like for the player to initially start out with nothing and be able to find a weapon somewhere in the scene to fight back against the emenies. 

In the course there will be a total of four rooms:
1. Starting room 
2. Combat room
3. Combat room
4. Finishing room

As far as mechanics, the first of the two combat rooms will feature enemies that need to be eliminated in order for the player to open the door and move on, while the second room will be more complex, feature potentially a second variant of enemy (flying, for example), and require a key card that the player needs to find in order to exit to the finish room. 

There will be health pickups in certain locations that will replenish the player's health bar, and there will be at least 1-2 different powerup items.

## Good Outcome
For a good outcome of the game, I'd like to have at least a basic three room setup: the starting room, one combat room featuring enemies that need to be eliminated, and the ending room. The combat room should employ the weapon equip mechanic and the health There should also be at least one music track, and basic combat and pickup sound effects. There should be a locked door that keeps the player from progressing, and there should at least be a start/title screen. 

## Better Outcome
For this version, the combat room should really be more complex, and feature one or two pickups. I am considering a shield item that can be activated whenever the player wants and that will run on a timer. I am also considering betentially a global hit item (all enemies get hit or stunned a certain incremental amount). The room should contain more obstacles, and I'd like for it to be vaguely maze-like, though that's not the main focus of the game. It just needs to feel more interesting and give the player walls to work with for the shooting-mechanic to feel more dynamic. Sound effects should reflect picking up powerups as well as using them, and the I'd like for the start room and finish room to have their own music variants. 

## Best Outcome
Here mainly I'd include a second combat room that employs the key card mechanic to open the final door, and the second enemy variant (flying). For the flying enemies, since aim will be more difficult, perhaps I can include a powerup item that guarantees a hit, or locks onto the enemy. Alternatively, a powerup that freezes enemies in place might work. The key card should require a bit of exploring to find, rather than being in a super obvious place, as this will add a bit of a puzzle aspect to an otherwise combat-centric gameplay experience. For audio, it would be nice to have a bit of dynamic mixing, perhaps smooth transitions between the different music of each of the rooms. I would love to also include a functional pause menu that allows the player to restart, go back to the title screen, or exit the game. 

## Next Steps
Really I think I'll need to refine my skills interfacing with Unity's 3d capabilities as they take a bit of getting used to for someone who comes from Blender. That being said, if I can figure out how to import models and materials from blender and have them smoothly show up in Unity, that would make the asset creation for my game a breeze. I'd say I'm the most concerned about getting the mechanics of combat to work, as raycasting and enemy AI feel a bit over my head at the moment. I'm also realizing the complexities of managing a health bar and pseudo-inventory, so I will need to get more comfortable in those areas.
