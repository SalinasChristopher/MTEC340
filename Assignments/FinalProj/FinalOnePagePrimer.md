# Roompath One-Page
---
### Concept
3d first-person shooter game that employs a room-to-room gameplay expeience. The goal is to get to the final room by eliminating enemies and unlocking doors without dying. 

### Gameplay
The player will have move from room-to-room, collecting a weapon and various items to aid them along the way. The player will be locked in each room until the necessary actions are completed to proceed. 

There will be health pickups, and various powerups, which the player must navigate the layout of the rooms to find. The player will find that enemies have an aggro-range and that walls will prove useful in defence against ranged attacks. 

### Interface

Basic 3d character controls. WASD keys to move, space to jump, various other keys for interacting with items.

### Art Style

The look of the game is minimal, relying on 3d primatives. Rooms will have basic rectangular architecture, and there will be point lights throughout the scene where necessary.
