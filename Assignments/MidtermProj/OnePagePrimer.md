# Platrunner One-Page
---
### Concept
2d sidescroll platformer-runner combination. The goal of the game is to reach the end of each level unscathed, and additionally pick up an item for a bonus. 
### Gameplay
The player will have to time jumps in order to jump from platform to platform and not fall into the abyss. 

Bonus items will be in more difficult to reach areas of the level, or at least not along the main path. 

### Interface
Gameply will rely soley on the player timing spacebar presses, similar to how *Geometry Dash* works.

### Art Style
Game will have a clean and minimal, if somewhat futuristic look. Platforms and obstacles will be based on primitives, and the player-character will be a ball or cube.
