# Midterm Project Proposal
---
### What will (likely) be the name of your game?
My game will probably be called *Platrunner*.

## Project Summary 
I plan on making a pretty simple platformer / endless runner type 2d game. It will scroll from right to left, and the player will be stationary on the screen but appear to be traveling infinitely from left to right. The player basically has to jump (space) at the right time in order to not fall and to avoid dangerous obstacles.I will build a few levels that progressively get more difficult. Each level will have items that you can collect for a bonus. This mechanic will be similar to the coins in *Geometry Dash*. In general my game will take much inspiration from *Geometry Dash*. 
## Good Outcome
I think at the very least, I'd like to have at least one levels completed that demonstrate the **jump/fall** and **item/bonus** mechanic. There will be a start screen, the  a "level failed" screen and "pause" screen. There should also be a simple "level complete" screen that shows wether the item bonus was collected or not.
## Better Outcome
A second level should be added which demonstrates a **dangerous obstacle** mechanic. Perhaps spikes or lava, something that would appear along platforms to make traversing more difficult. Perhaps this version of the game would have a "level select" screen as well. 
## Best Outcome
In addition to adding a third level, I think in this version I'd really focus on the cosmetics of the game. The "level select" screen should display wether the player has passed a previous level or not, and lock the player out of new ones if the previous ones have not been passed. I may include within each level an **attempt  count** that shows how many tries the player has had for the given session. The "pause" screen should have buttons that take the player to either "level select" or the title screen. Overall I'd imagine the graphics being a bit more refined here as well. Instead of just primitaves, I'd design custom assets that look nice, and each level would have a distinctly unique atmosphere. 
## Next Steps
I expect that I will require a firmer understanding of collisions in order to implement the ground-contact feature, as well as a gravity system to pull the player into the abyss if they miss a jump. I will also need to figure out a game manager that has different states and shows the players scores, etc. This is honestly the part I'm the most concerned about, since I missed the class where the game manager was covered.
