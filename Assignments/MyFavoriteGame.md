### Intro
I think my favorite game as of now is *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*. It is a game developed by **[Nintendo] (https://www.nintendo.com/us/)** and was released on March 3, 2017. According to what I've seen online, the game uses a combination of Nintendo's propriety engines and a modified version of the Havok physics engine.

### Why I like Zelda: Breath of the Wild

*BOTW* is probably the closest game I've ever played to a truly open world wherein you can explore everything with very little restriction. I feel that in many "open world" games there are still very clear bounds as far as what the player is capable of doing, and the open-worldness ends up really being relegated to whatever patches of the map the game has designated for free-roaming. In *BOTW*, however, the climbing and paragliding mechanics make it so that, with the exception of building stamina as you progress, there are really no limits to where you can explore. I really like the attention to the aesthetic of everything in the game as well. I find the music to be very tasteful, and the sound design is extremely fitting for he nature-filled design of the game. I also appreciate how much content is included in the game that is purely optional--this really adds to the degree of freedom that the *BOTW* world offers.

### Similar Games

* **[Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom] (https://zelda.nintendo.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/)**. This is an obvious one, seeing as how it's the sequel to *Breath of the Wild*.

* **[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim] (https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en)**. I've read that the development team on *BOTW* took inspiration from the open world elements in *Skyrim*.

* **[Genshin Impact] (https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/)**. The similarities are pretty clear in the environment design, and I think the dev team themselves even cited *BOTW* as inspiration at one point.
